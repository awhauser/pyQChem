## pyQChem - Input/Output-Tools for Q-Chem
 

PyQChem is a Python module designed for an intuitive manipulation of
[Q-Chem](http://www.q-chem.com) input and output files.
It was written with special focus on the features of [IPython](http://ipython.org) such as tab completion and easy access to help docstrings via the question mark operator.

To use pyQChem in your Python environment, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/awhauser/pyQChem.git
cd pyQChem
python setup.py install
```

Two IPython notebooks (and support files) are provided as an introduction
to basic inputfile handling and outputfile parsing.
Example Python scripts that use pyQChem can be found in the 'demos' directory.
